### Getting Started:

This project is not deployed (yet), and repo is just the front end. It won't work without the back end being spun up. This is the repo for the back end: https://github.com/ShujaatAzim/TweedleDoo-Backend

Once that has been pulled down and cloned, spin up the rails server on localhost port 3000. 

### Try it out!

Once this repo has been pulled/cloned, run `npm install` for the dependencies. Then run `npm start` in this project to start it up!

You can register a new user by adding an email/username and a password. There are no password requirements just yet. However, a username/email must be unique.

The login credentials are currently stored in browser local storage.

After you have created a user or logged in, you are able to play around with the app! Explore the full CRUD functionality!

Have fun!
